## Familiar Plotting Interface

rCharts uses a plotting interface that R users are already familiar with. You can use a formula interace as used in the lattice package, or a more traditionaly interface used with base graphics.

## Multile Libraries

rCharts supports multiple javascript charting libraries, each with its own strengths. Each of these libraries has multiple customization options, most of which are supported within rCharts.
